# Project-2 -- Potluck Planner

* Purpose:
  The purpose of this application is to provide a centralized location for clients to manage a food potluck event.  

* Organization:
  The MVC method of file organization was used for the creation of this application. The application is organized in two pages:
  * Page 1 -- Home Page
    User can enter their name and the food item they want to bring to the potluck event.

  * Page 2 -- Display Page
    This page displays a master list of all the foods that have been added to the potluck list. It also provides access for users to provide feedback with a comments section.

App Instructions:
* Home Page
    * 1. The user enters their name and picks a category.
    * 2. If the user knows what they want to bring, they enter the food item and then click 'submit'.
    * 3. If the user doesn't know what they want to bring, they can click on the 'I don't know' button and receive a random meal recommendation.  After they make a decision, their choice will prepopulate in the food item feild and the user clicks 'submit'.

*  Display Page
    * 1. After the user clicks 'submit' on home page, they are automatically taken to the display page.
    * 2. The display page will show a master list of all food items and allow the user to delete their option by clicking on the 'remove from menu' button.
    * 3. The user is also able to enter feedback using the comments section.
