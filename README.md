# Project-2 -- Potluck Planner

* Purpose:
  The purpose of this application is to provide a centralized location for clients to manage a food potluck event.  

* Organization:
  The MVC method of file organization was used for the creation of this application. The application is organized in two pages:
  * Page 1 -- Home Page
    This page allows the user to add their food item to the master list.

  * Page 2 -- Display Page
    This page displays a master list of all the foods that have been added to the potluck list and provides the ability to chat with other users.

App Instructions:
* Home Page
    * 1. The user enters their name and picks a category.
    * 2. If the user knows what they want to bring, they enter the food item and then click 'submit'.
    * 3. If the user doesn't know what they want to bring, they choose a food category and click 'search'.  The user will be given a random recipe.
    * 4. If the user likes the search result, they will add the dish name to the form and click 'submit'.
    * 5. The user is automatically taken to the display page after clicking submit.

*  Display Page
    * 1. The display page is divided into two tabs:
        * a. The Foods Tab -- the user will be able to view a list of all foods currently on the potluck food list.  The user will also be able to filter the list based on who added the food list entry.

        * b. The chat tab -- the user will be able to chat will other users concerning the party and food submissions.
